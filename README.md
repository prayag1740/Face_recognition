# Face_recognition
The purpose of this project is to detect the face of the user from the database which we will create .
The camera will detect the face of the person and take 40 frames of the person and store in the database . This will be done in db_creator file and is done for the persons which we want to recognise.
After creating the database we will the train our data using trainer.py file and will create a .yml file .
After which we can recognise the image of the person .
